# Base-converter
This base converter is great for all use cases between base 2 to 36.
Positive, negative, fractional and whole numbers are supported.
Alphanumeric characters are also supported for higher bases.
Initially designed it for my brother to use to practice for his national examinationa has we couldn't find a similar powerful one online for free.
Can easily be extended to take care of higher bases, if needed.
Everyone is free to contribute, pull and use.
